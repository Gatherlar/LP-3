                <h1>Data Retrieval- Mongo Collection</h1>
                <p>
                    This section looks at coding the Find methods.
                    To start with we will look at the MongoCollection class to actually make the calls. Quickly describe ‘Cursors’ and how they differ from a usual ADO implementation.
                    And then finally go through how mapping the data from the document gets directly into the classes you have made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A MongoCollection object is essentially the object you use to get data back. It’s a generic type and you add the Class type in the definition. This class has a 3 types of find:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>FindAll</b>  which simply fills the cursor with all results from a document
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Find</b> which takes search criteria
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>FindOne</b> which always returns one result even if more than one record is found (the first logically stored one)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When you use Find the MongoCollection returns a Cursor which isn’t actually the data, it’s a pointer to it. Its only when you access the data items is the data actually brought back. The data is then mapped directrly for you to use.
                </p>

                <h3>Class Definition</h3>

                <p>
                    The properties defined here must match <u>exactly</u>     how the fields are defined in the document and the mapping will work. If this does not happen, an error will occur.
                </p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>
                    First a simple Class called Carer.
                </p>
                <pre class="output">
    public class Carer
    {
        public ObjectId _id;
        public string forename;
        public string surname;
    }
                </pre>                    
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">

                <p>
                    Then define a MongoCollection with the Carer passed in:
                </p>
                <pre class="output">
    private MongoCollection &lt;carer&gt; _carer;
                </pre>
                
                <p>
                    The definition here with the generic of Carer then maps the cursor and its results directly to the class.
                    This means each document returned will be of type Carer.

                <h3>Using FindOneByID</h3>

                <p>
                    This method will always return the first physically added document back. 
                    Although it seems odd, i have needed this in the past where i simply just want one record.
                    <br/><br/>

                    To use the FindOneByID the object is realised immediately and populates the CarerObject
                </p>
                <pre class="output">
public Carer GetCarerByID(string carerId)
{
    return _carers.FindOneById(carerId);
}

                </pre>


            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Using Find / FindAll</h3>

                <p>
                    When using the Find where more than one result is returned the cursor 
                    is more obvious. 
                    You cannot simply take the cursor returned and place it in a C# collection 
                    class such as a list object, you must loop through and place each returned 
                    item (which is of the correct type) into a List collection of that type.                     
                    <br /><br />
                </p>
                <pre class="output">
private CarerObjs GetAllCarers()
{
    CarerObjs Carers = new CarerObjs();
    var CarersFound = _carers.FindAll();
    foreach (var carer in CarersFound)
    {
        Carers.Add(carer);
    }
    return Carers;
    }


                </pre>
                <p>
                    So just to describe, the CarersFound object is actually of type MongoCursor, and then when you look 
                    in the class using the foreach the object is then realised.

                <h3>Decorating/Mapping other libraries</h3>

                <p>
                    It might be possible that some other class needs to be mapped without accessing the class directly.For example, it might not be my library file to change. 
                    So, there is also a ClassMap object which allows the class to be decorated on initialisation like this.
                </p>
                <h3>Example</h3>

                <pre class="output">
BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap&lt;myclass&gt; 
(cm =&gt; { 
        cm.MapProperty(c =&gt; c.SomeProperty); 
        cm.MapProperty(c =&gt; c.AnotherProperty); 
});                   
                </pre>
