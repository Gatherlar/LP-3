                MongoDB (from humongous) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. First developed in 2007 its gradually become very popular. Its classified as a NoSQL database and turns the traditional table-based relational database structure on its head in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON).
                This makes the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. MongoDB is free and open-source software and allows you to build really flexible models.

                <b>Git</b>  is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

                <b>GitHub</b> is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
                <p></p>
                Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.

                Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
                Its basically like an electronic version of our boards, however it allows you to share with remote sites and updates immediately. Its really cool and the free version is not that limited!!
