                <h4>Creating Boards</h4>

                <p>Creating a board is simple. Once you have an account and you are signed into the Trello website, click the boards link <img src="..\images\trello-board.PNG" alt="Trello Boards Button Image"> in the top left corner and select "Create new board..."</p>
                
                <p>All you then have to do is name your board and select the privacy level:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Private - Only people specifically added to this board can view and edit it</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Organisation - Visibile to members of the organisation. Only members added to the board can edit.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Public - Visible to anyone with the link and will show up in search engines. Only people added to the board can edit</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Once the board is created you can add members who can contribute to the board. This is done by clicking the Add members icon <img src="..\images\trello-add-mamber.PNG" alt="Trello Add Member Button Image"> found on the side menu.</p>
                
                <p>The boards are organised into lists. These can be thought of as the different swimlanes on our existing kanban boards and can be added by clicking "Add a list..."</p>
                
                <p>Once the list have been setup you can start adding stories and tasks.</p>
